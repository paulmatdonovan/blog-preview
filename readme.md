## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   CSS Grid

### What I learned

Initially, I attempted to center the container by applying display: flex directly to the container div. Later, I realized the flex properties needed to be on the parent element (e.g., body) for proper centering using justify-content: center and align-items: center. This resolved the alignment issue.
Responsiveness Concerns
The container adapts well to most screen sizes but breaks on very small viewports (e.g., below 300px). I’m unsure if this edge case needs further optimization or if it’s acceptable given typical device constraints.
Styling Implementation
• Applied background colors and global styles efficiently.
• Paddings and margins were carefully adjusted to maintain visual balance.
Areas for Improvement:
• Test edge cases for ultra-small screens (e.g., min-width constraints).
• Revisit the flexbox approach to ensure consistency.

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.
